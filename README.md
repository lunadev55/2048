# 2048
2048 game in python 3.4.3

- I will be developing this simple game based on the experience
i had playing it and analysing it + my basic skills on python.

1 - So far it will be as simple as possible, it will have a "record" variable which will be the highest points a player gets in the game, it will have a score which so far will be pretty simple, will add +1 after each successful played, it will also have pretty simple commands as described below:

	8 = up
	2 = down
	4 = left
	6 = right

	After each typed command you must hit enter to go on.

2 - All of this is just the beginning of this project, all content here
is able to be changed till the end of the development.
